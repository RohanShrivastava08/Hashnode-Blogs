Hey folks üëã  
I recently discovered something really cool ‚Äî the **Claude Code** extension for **VS Code** by **Anthropic**. If you're into AI-powered coding help (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), then this might just excite you too!

In this short blog, I‚Äôll walk you through how I got started with it, how it works, and what you need to do if you want to try it yourself.

### üß† What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a VS Code extension powered by Anthropic‚Äôs Claude models ‚Äî large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT but with their own twist. Claude is known for being very helpful, precise, and aligned with human feedback. It can help you:

* Auto-complete code
    
* Explain blocks of code
    
* Fix bugs
    
* Write tests
    
* Answer questions right inside VS Code

### üîß How I Set It Up

Setting it up was pretty easy. Here‚Äôs what I did:

#### 1\. **Read the Docs First**

Before anything, I went through the official Claude Code documentation to understand what‚Äôs needed. It‚Äôs well-written and beginner-friendly.

#### 2\. **Get Your API Key**

To use Claude Code, you need an **Anthropic API key**. You can get this by signing up for an account at console.anthropic.com. Once signed in, you can generate your API key from the dashboard.

#### 3\. **Install the Extension in VS Code**

I opened VS Code, searched for **Claude Code** in the Extensions tab, and installed it. Easy-peasy!

#### 4\. **Configure the API Key**

After installation, I opened the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and searched for `Claude: Set API Key`. I pasted the API key I got earlier, and boom üí• ‚Äî it was ready to go!

### ‚ö°Ô∏è First Impressions

Once it was live, I tried writing a few functions and Claude started suggesting clean and contextual completions. It even explained my messy code and refactored it when I asked. All this, without ever leaving VS Code. It felt like having a super smart coding buddy inside my editor.

### üåü Why You Should Try It

If you're:

* A developer who likes AI help
    
* Already using VS Code
    
* Curious about Claude's capabilities
    
* Tired of switching windows for ChatGPT
    

...then you should definitely give **Claude Code** a shot.

### üîö Final Thoughts

I'm still exploring it, but Claude Code looks promising. It‚Äôs fast, feels lightweight, and just works. If you're already using other AI dev tools, Claude is worth adding to your toolbox. Plus, it's backed by one of the most exciting AI labs right now ‚Äî **Anthropic**.

Let me know if you‚Äôve tried it too or need help setting it up. I‚Äôll keep posting updates as I explore more.
