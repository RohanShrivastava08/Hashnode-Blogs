# Introduction

* Recently, I explored **ShadCN UI**, and I must say, it’s one of the best UI component libraries I’ve come across.
    
* If you are a developer who loves clean, accessible, and highly customizable UI components, this is something you should definitely try.
    
* In this blog, I’ll share my experience with ShadCN UI, how to use it, and why it stands out from other UI libraries.

## What is ShadCN UI?

* ShadCN UI is a **modern and customizable UI component library** built on top of **Radix UI** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
    
* Unlike traditional UI libraries that provide pre-styled themes, ShadCN UI gives **fully customizable** components that seamlessly integrate into your design system.
    
* Instead of installing a package, you copy and use the actual component code in your project, which means:  
    ✅ Full control over styles and logic  
    ✅ No dependency on package updates  
    ✅ Lightweight and efficient

## How to Install ShadCN UI in Your Project

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have a Next.js or React project set up. If not, create one using:

```javascript
shCopynpx create-next-app@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

Then, install **ShadCN UI CLI**:

```javascript
shCopynpm install shadcn-ui@latest -g
```

### **Step 2: Initialize ShadCN UI**

Run the following command inside your project:

```javascript
shCopynpx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

This will guide you through the setup process, asking for your preferred configurations.

### **Step 3: Add Components**

Once initialized, you can start adding components. For example, to add a **button**, run:

```javascript
shCopynpx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

This will generate a `components/ui/button.tsx` file with the full component code, which you can modify freely.
