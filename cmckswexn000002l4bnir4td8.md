Lately, I’ve been exploring new AI tools to make my workflow smoother, and one that truly surprised me is **Google NotebookLM**.

Yes, you heard it right — not Google Docs, not Keep — but **NotebookLM**, Google’s AI-powered research assistant that feels like a smart notebook + chat tool + content creator, all rolled into one!

## 🧠 What is Google NotebookLM?

In simple terms, NotebookLM (LM = Language Model) is a new experiment from Google that helps you **upload your content — PDFs, Docs, images, notes — and then chat with it like an AI assistant.** You can ask questions, summarize information, generate ideas, and even create audio content.

I stumbled upon it while looking for an AI tool to manage my daily planning and research. Honestly, I didn’t expect much, but it blew me away!

## ✅ How I Used NotebookLM

Let me walk you through how I’ve been using it:

### 1\. ✍️ Planning My Day with a Prompt

I just started by giving it a **simple prompt**:  
*"Help me plan my day with a balanced schedule of work, reading, learning, health, and small breaks."*

And boom — it created a **custom schedule**, including focused work blocks, time for reading, healthy breaks, and even moments for reflection. No app-install, no complex setup.

### 2\. 📁 Uploading Content for Context

Then I uploaded a few resources — PDFs and some images related to my current reading list and self-improvement blogs.

NotebookLM did something amazing: it **scanned everything**, and now when I chat, it answers based on the documents I uploaded. It even **finds key insights** and **summarizes long text** quickly.

### 3\. 🎧 It Made Me an Audio Podcast!

This was honestly next-level. I asked it to turn a summary into a short podcast — and it did!

It generated an **audio version of the notes** with a calm, podcast-like tone. I could **download it** and listen to my summary while walking. Productivity + peace = ✅
