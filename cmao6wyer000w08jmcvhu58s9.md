Hey there! 👋

If you're like me, you probably love trying out new AI tools to make life easier. Two of the most talked-about ones these days are **ChatGPT** and **Perplexity AI**. I’ve been using both for a while now, and today I want to share a super simple and honest comparison based on my daily experience.

## 🧠 What Are They?

### ✅ ChatGPT

ChatGPT is like a **friendly, smart friend** you can chat with anytime. You can ask it questions, get help writing stuff, brainstorm ideas, or even learn something new all in a conversational way.

### ✅ Perplexity AI

Perplexity AI is like a **supercharged search engine**. It's fast, gives short and useful answers, and always shows where it got its information from which is great if you want trusted sources.

## 💼 Real-Life Use Cases

Let me break it down with examples from my daily life:

| 📚 Learning a topic | Explains it step-by-step in easy words | Gives links to articles & quick facts |
| 🧾 Making a to-do list | Can generate and organize my list | Doesn’t really do this |
| 🧪 Research for a project | Decent, but no sources unless browsing is enabled | Shows real-time sources & links |
| 🍝 Finding dinner ideas | Creative recipes with ingredients | Quick suggestions with links to food blogs |
| 📰 Checking latest news | Limited (unless Pro with browsing) | Up-to-date news with references |
| 💻 Coding help | Explains code, fixes bugs, writes scripts | Not good for full code help |
