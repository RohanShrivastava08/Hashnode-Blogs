### Introduction

* Postman is a popular API (Application Programming Interface) testing tool that simplifies the process of developing and testing APIs.
    
* It provides a user-friendly interface to make HTTP requests and view responses, making it an essential tool for developers.
    
* Website Link: www.postman.com
    

### Key Features of Postman

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and use.
    
2. **API Request Building**: Supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
    
3. **Collections**: Organize requests into collections for better management.
    
4. **Environment Variables**: Manage different environments (like development, staging, production) with variable settings.
    
5. **Testing and Automation**: Built-in tools for writing tests and automating workflows.
    
6. **Collaboration**: Share collections and environments with your team.
    

### Getting Started with Postman

#### 1\. Installation

* **Download**: Visit the Postman website to download the application.
    
* **Installation**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    

#### 2\. Creating a New Request

* **Open Postman**: Launch the application.
    
* **New Request**: Click on "New" and select "Request".
    
* **Request Name**: Enter a name for your request and choose or create a collection to save it.
    

#### 3\. Building and Sending a Request

* **Select Method**: Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) from the dropdown.
    
* **Enter URL**: Type the API endpoint URL.
    
* **Headers and Parameters**: Add any necessary headers or query parameters.
    
* **Body**: If the request type requires a body (like POST), add the data in the Body tab.
    
* **Send**: Click "Send" to make the request.
    

### Using Collections and Environments

#### 1\. Collections

* **Creating Collections**: Click on "New" and select "Collection".
    
* **Organizing Requests**: Add requests to collections for easy management and categorization.
    

#### 2\. Environments

* **Creating Environments**: Click on the gear icon next to the environment dropdown and select "Manage Environments".
    
* **Variables**: Define variables for different environments (e.g., `{{base_url}}`) to avoid hardcoding values.
    

### Writing Tests in Postman

* **Tests Tab**: After building your request, navigate to the "Tests" tab.
    
* **JavaScript Code**: Write test scripts using JavaScript to validate the response.
    
* **Common Tests**:
    
    * Check response status: `pm.test("Status code is 200", function () { pm.response.to.have.status(200); });`
        
    * Validate response time: `pm.test("Response time is less than 200ms", function () { pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(200); });`
        

### Automating Workflows

#### 1\. Newman

* **Installation**: Install Newman (a CLI tool for Postman) using npm: `npm install -g newman`.
    
* **Running Collections**: Execute Postman collections through command line with Newman for automation: `newman run your-collection.json`.
    

#### 2\. Monitors

* **Setting Up Monitors**: Schedule automatic runs of your Postman collections via the Monitors feature in the Postman app.
    
* **Monitoring API Health**: Use monitors to ensure your APIs are functioning correctly over time.
    

### Collaboration and Sharing

* **Team Workspaces**: Create and manage team workspaces for collaborative API development.
    
* **Sharing Collections**: Share collections via public URLs or directly within the team workspace.
    
* **Documentation**: Automatically generate and share API documentation using Postmanâ€™s documentation feature.
