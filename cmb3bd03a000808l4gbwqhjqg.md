Hey everyone 👋

I recently made a big switch in my developer setup — moved from my **Lenovo Legion Y540 (Windows)** to the sleek and powerful **MacBook Air M3**. And let me tell you, as a frontend developer who codes daily in **React, TailwindCSS, and Node.js**, it’s been a game-changer.

I thought I’d share my honest experience for anyone who's planning to switch or is curious about how the MacBook performs for coding in general.

### 🖥️ My Old Setup: Lenovo Legion Y540

This was my first serious machine — solid performance with a dedicated GPU (GTX 1650), good keyboard, and Windows 10. I used it for everything — coding, design, browsing, and sometimes even gaming.

But slowly I started noticing a few things:

* Battery life was average. I had to stay plugged in most of the time.
    
* The fan noise would go **crazy** during builds or while running VS Code + Chrome + a local server.
    
* It felt heavy to carry and not very portable.
    
* Windows updates — well, they were a pain sometimes 😅
    

Still, it was a good machine that helped me learn and grow.

### 🚀 Enter the MacBook Air M3

I always heard people say “Mac just feels smooth for devs” — and now I get it.

The MacBook Air M3 has been an **absolute delight** to work with.

### 💡 The Key Differences I Felt Instantly:

#### 1\. **Speed and Silence**

The first thing I noticed? **It’s blazing fast and completely silent.**  
No fan, no heat, no lag — even when running a dev server, multiple terminals, VS Code, Chrome tabs, and Figma together.

#### 2\. **Battery Life 🔋**

Easily lasts me **12-14 hours** on normal dev usage.  
Compared to the 2–3 hours I used to get on my old machine, this felt insane.

#### 3\. **Terminal & Unix Power**

I didn’t know I’d love the **Mac terminal** so much.  
I feel more in control using zsh + oh-my-zsh, and most dev tools are optimized for Unix-based systems — from Git to Node, everything just works better.

#### 4\. **Trackpad + Gestures 🖱️**

Honestly, the MacBook trackpad is on another level.  
I barely use a mouse now. The **smooth gestures**, mission control, and swipe between apps boost my productivity more than I expected.

#### 5\. **Display & Design 👀**

The **Retina display** is super crisp — I enjoy coding and even just looking at my UI designs more.  
And the MacBook itself? **Thin, light, and premium AF.**

#### 6\. **No More Random Distractions**

Mac feels minimal. There’s **less bloat**, fewer interruptions, and more focus.  
I actually enjoy sitting down to code now — which says a lot!

### 🛠️ Developer Tools I Use Now

* **VS Code (with extensions)**
    
* **iTerm2 + zsh**
    
* **Homebrew** for installing stuff
    
* **Node, npm, pnpm, nvm** — smooth setup
    
* **Figma** runs beautifully
    
* **Chrome + Arc Browser** for testing

### 😅 A Few Things That Took Time

Not everything was instant-perfect. I had to:

* Learn Mac shortcuts and gestures
    
* Get used to no "right-click" behavior (but trackpad gestures made up for it)
    
* Reconfigure some keybindings in VS Code
    
* Re-learn copy-paste and navigation shortcuts (`Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`)
    

But all of this took just **2–3 days** and now it feels natural.

### 🌟 Final Thoughts

I didn’t expect a laptop to **motivate me to code more**, but that’s exactly what happened.

If you’re a developer thinking about switching to the **MacBook Air M3**, I’d say: **go for it.** It’s light, powerful, silent, and battery-friendly — perfect for web development.

My Lenovo served me well, but this MacBook?  
Feels like I levelled up. ⚡
